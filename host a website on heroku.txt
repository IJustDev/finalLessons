after we installed the heroku CLI we need to do the following:

* open cmd and run : heroku login

* after we logged in with our user we need to do the following:

* nevigate the the root directory of the project.

* run the command:  heroku create

* run the command: npm init
* run the command: npm install body-parser express request
* run the command: > Procfile
(it cerates a file called Procfile that has to type extention, it can't be called Procfile.txt).

* open the Procfile and write this i
nside: web: node app.js.

* in the root directory create a new file called app.js



* copy and paste the following to the app.js file:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const express = require("express");
const request = require("request");

const app = express();

app.use(express.static("public"));

app.get("/" , function(req, res){
    res.sendFile(__dirname + "index.html");
});

// we write "|| 3000" for localhost testing 
app.listen(process.env.PORT ||3000, function(){
    console.log("Server is running on port 3000!!!");
});

-----------------------------------------------------------------

* create a folder called "public" in the root directory of the project. ( it has to have the same name that is written in the command : 'app.use(express.static("public"));' in the app.js file).

* move all the project files that we wrote (html, css, js , execpt app.js) to the public folder.

* run: git push heroku master

after this command the url of the website will be written in the output. for exapmple:
https://calm-peak-58723.herokuapp.com

every time we want to update the website we need to run : git push heroku master
